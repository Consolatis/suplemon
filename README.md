              Remedying the pain of command line editing since 2014


Intuitive command line text editor with multicursor support. Suplemon replicates Sublime Text style functionality in the terminal with the ease of use of Nano.
# Suplemon multicursor editing:
![Suplemon in action](http://bittemple.org/misc/suplemon/suplemon-demo.gif)

# Usage:

    python3 main.py [filename]...

*Must use python3 for proper character encoding support.*
*Tested on Unix.*

# Features
 * Terminal text editing with style
 * Proper multi cursor editing, Sublime Text style. Blessed!
 * Easy Undo/Redo
 * Multiple files in tabs
 * Powerful Go To feature for jumping to files and lines
 * Copy & Paste, with multi line support
 * Find and Find next
 * Extensions (easy to write your own)

# Goals
 1. [X] Create a command line text editor with built in multi cursor support. Damn it's amazing!
 2. [X] Usability should be as good and easy as nano.
 3. [X] Multi cursor ~~and multi selection~~ should be comparable to Sublimetext.
 4. [X] Develop Suplemon with Suplemon!!! I already use Suplemon for all command line editing,
        Git commits, and a lot of developement.

# Todo

 * [X] CSS highlighter
 * [X] Move the editor view (scroll) down when finding multiple occurances
 * [X] The following solved with global exit check (if any file is modified but not saved)
   * [X] Close files one at a time with 'save?' prompt.
 * [X] Prompt for close or exit confirmation only when file(s) have been modified
 * [X] Indicate if file was saved successfully or if it failed
 * [X] Better yes/no query for exit (and in general)
 * [X] Generic linelighter for generic highlighting
 * [X] Editor plugins/extensions/macros
   * [ ] Design proper API
   * [X] Trim command to get rid of trailing whitespace
   * [X] Lower/Upper/Reverse lettercase (todo: reverse case)
   * [X] Reverse line
 * [X] New file and close file
 * [X] Undo / Redo
 * [X] Move config file to user home directory
 * [X] File type detection for highlighting
 * [X] Duplicate line (without clipboard)
 * [X] Use semver
 * [X] Nano-like menu and keyboard shortcuts with legend. TODO: respect future custom bindings
 * [X] Go to file as well as line number
 * [X] Show if file is edited
 * [X] Copy / Paste buffer
 * [X] Proper status bar information
 * [X] Jump to end of whitespace with home key
 * [X] Command line for getting input
 * [X] Line number toggling
 * [X] Loading multiple files and switching between them
 * [X] Live config reloading when it's modified
 * [X] Line based syntax highlighting

# Whishlist (Stuff that would be nice, but not planning to do yet. Maybe for 2.0.0)
 * [Â ] Add option to change ESCDELAY (function keys aren't detected on slow connections)
 * [ ] Global clipboard (copy from one file to another)
 * [ ] Indicate if file isn't writable (in status bar). Use os.access(path, os.W_OK)
 * [ ] Custom key bindings
 * [ ] Auto complete
 * [ ] Selections
 * [ ] Proper syntax higlighting
   * [ ] Combine line based highlighters and other language related data (include comment syntax etc)
   * [ ] Default to legendary Monokai colors 
         http://www.monokai.nl/blog/2006/07/15/textmate-color-theme/
 * [ ] File selector, kind of like what nano has
 * [ ] Store files and cursor positions for and restoring on next run
 * [ ] Feature to automatically add ; to end of lines
    * [ ] Generalized: add line prepend and append commands
    * [ ] Will need multiline comment and string detection etc.
 * [ ] Setting for enabling/disabling undo for cursor changes
 * [ ] Read only viewer
    * ~~And disable editing~~ Don't disable editing. Instead enable save as.
 * [ ] Syntax specific commenting.
 * [ ] Display tab characters with a replacement char (tab messes up lines)
 * [ ] Optimize rendering for ssh (minimal screen update)
   * [ ] Only refresh cursors when moving around
   * [ ] Only refresh modified lines when editing

# Fix / Defects
 * [ ] With multiple lines selected pressing backspace and enter makes changes (shouldn't)
 * [ ] Remember find query if occurance not found (jump to top of file)
 * [ ] Input queries can't detect trailing whitespace
 * [X] Unreliable undo/redo.
 * [X] Refine find and find_next commands.
 * [X] Don't forget string to find automatically when using Ctrl + F 
 * [X] Finish refactoring viewer.py and editor.py
 * [X] Cut command fails when multiple cursors are on or close to the last line
 * [X] Fix 'finding' empty character. Revert to 'add_cursor_right'.
 * [X] Better auto find with ctrl+d. (Find the current word or character)
 * [X] Forget last find on esc.
 * [X] Return code 0 on exit:
       Curses forces code 130 and causes git to ignore saved commit message, argh!
 * [X] ~~Can't open files that have spaces in them.~~ Works when using 'file\ name'
 * [X] Config extension double loads config file, instead of switching to it
 * [X] Encoding errors 
 * [X] Remove "Failed to load config." when file doesn't exist
 * [X] Delete key when cursor at line end; ~~add dedicated setting~~ made to work as normal.
 * [X] Make adding cursors up and down smarter: add them at main cursor x coordinate if possible
 * [X] Saving file into a directory stores the relative path as the filename.
 * [X] Cursors sometimes left hanging at non existent coordinates (eg. when file reloaded)
       Solved by rectifying all cursors in move_cursors. Should optimize more in callers.
 * [X] Remove debug logging in non-debug mode
 * [X] Fill in incomplete config file with defaults
 * [X] Add 'remove previous cursor' function (fixed with undo/redo)
 * [X] Can't open files like '~/.suplemon-config.json'
 * [X] Cursor invisible when at end of scrolled line
 * [X] Esc key effect is delayed
 * [X] Fixed: Find starts at top of file instead of current ~~line~~ cursor
 * [X] Start find at current line AND column
 * [X] Make editor white color brighter (not gray)
 * [X] Show editor at top of terminal when show_top_bar == False
